# mpc_algorithms
Repository for the Model Predictive Control (MPC) architecture. 
Designed and tested by Michael Napoli as a part of the Ohio State University Cyberbotics Lab. 
Continuation of the **michaelnaps/lipm.git** repository.

To see most up-to-date algorithms, see the */digit* folder which contains specialized controller functions
corresponding to the **digit_matlab_sim** repository's **mpc** branch.

The functions found in the */mlab* folder will eventually be generalized to work with a given
configuration space and simulator, but are currently written for the use of an n-link pendulum model.

For generalized system check the **general** branch of this repository (in development).
