# mpc_algorithms
Repository for the Model Predictive Control (MPC) architecture. 
Designed and tested by Michael Napoli as a part of the Ohio State University Cyberbotics Lab. 
Continuation of the michaelnaps/lipm.git repository.

To see most up-to-date algorithms, see the **/digit** folder which contains specialized controller functions
which correspond to the __digit_matlab_sim__ repository.

The functions found in the **/mlab** folder will eventually be generalized to work with a given
configuration space and simulator, but are currently written for the use of an n-link pendulum model.
